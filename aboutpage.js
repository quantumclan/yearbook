var opinionAboutCourse=[
    "Physics is a course that stands out amongst other science courses, it helps us understand different aspect of the universe while establishing the basic laws of the universe. I am proud to be a Physics student",
"It's relatively relatable in the sense that I tend to observe my surroundings in a different kind of way, and physics gives me the liberty to do so, even if a person just dey struggle.",
    "Physics is my course of study and it's a broad and interesting course in science.",
    "Very lucrative course I would love to further",
"Physics is a really decent course, it’s basically the foundation of almost everything that exists post humans, so in my opinion, its great",
"Honestly, my course of study wasn’t my first option, but I’ve come to appreciate it more than I expected. Initially, I had different interests, but as I delved deeper into physics, I found a unique beauty and challenge in it that I didn’t anticipate. It has pushed me to think differently and develop skills I never thought I would gain. While it’s been a journey of adjustment, I’m grateful for the opportunities it presents and the knowledge I’m gaining along the way.",
"It's a very strict course to study. One has to be consistent with studying to follow up. It is complex in nature and deals with critical thinking.",
"It’s an amazing and unique course",
"My honest opinion on my course of study is that I can say is one of the best courses to study where you can impact yourself and the whole world at large in a positive way.",
"It’s really not for the weak",
"Physics is the study of the universe, it shares ideas about what we see around us and how they operate",
"I study physics, and I believe it’s one of the most fascinating and impactful fields out there. It helps me understand how the world works, from the smallest particles to the vast phenomena of the universe. What makes it even more exciting is seeing how the principles of physics can be applied in real life, whether it’s in technology, energy, medicine, or solving everyday problems.",
"Wow, Physics! It's actually an amazing course, although technical but it gives a ready mind a desire to be highly inquisitive and interested in knowing facts.",
"Honestly, I would say that my course of study is both challenging and incredibly intriguing. Physics ever since my secondary school years seemed complex and in fact almost intimidating, but at the same time physics makes the world go round, gives a deep understanding of how the universe works, from the smallest particles to the largest of them.However, it’s not without its challenges. It can be overwhelming at times. There are moments when it feels almost impossible to grasp, when juggling topics like quantum mechanics or relativity for instance, but moments happen where everything clicks into place, making it all worth it. Physics requires a lot of hard work and dedication along the way.",
"It’s a course for people who actually want knowledge for knowledge. People who want to know because they care to know.",
"Physics is an incredibly rewarding field for those who are curious about how the universe works. It challenges you to think critically and apply logic to solve complex problems. While it can be rigorous, especially with its reliance on mathematics, it offers a unique way of understanding everything from the smallest particles to the largest cosmic structures. It’s a study of the 'why' and 'how' behind the world, making it both challenging and deeply fulfilling.",
"Interesting",
"It’s an interesting course",
"It's very broad",
"Physics is a great course of study because it teaches you about so many things",

"Physics is life",
"It's kind of challenging and tough. But so am I",
"It cuts across countless mechanical activities of our lives and particularly my future ambition of becoming a pilot. That's my honest opinion.",
"It's quite an impressive course that is changing and would change lives and ways of living",
"I find my course of study intriguing and highly relevant. It challenges me to think critically and equips me with skills necessary for real-world applications.",
"It wasn't my pick of study, but physics explains the fundamental law of the universe and it's quite demanding, requiring math and the ability to connect abstract concepts with real-world phenomena. It has revolutionized the world.",
"Physics is an incredible field, and I have a lot of admiration for its depth and elegance",
"Well, physics generally is tedious but honestly I'm enjoying the ride because it shown me how solutions to real life issues are been tackled also helping to shape me for a better future"
